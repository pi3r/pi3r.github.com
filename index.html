          <p>Hi there,</p>
          <p>You're probably here because you need someone to help you create something.</p>
          <p>If this "something" is somewhat related to web development, I can help you.</p>
          <p>I crafted many web applications and I can put my experience at your disposal in a lot ways.</p>
          <p>If you find yourself in one of the following position:
            <ul>
              <li>You have an idea but don't know how to put it on paper.</li>
              <li>Your idea is clear as crystal but you need someone to help you craft it.</li>
              <li>You already have a project but you want it to evolve.</li>
              <li>You are running late on your deadline and you need more manpower.</li>
              <li>You heard about me and want to have a chat.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Community Driven</h3>
            <p>
              I love the communities that evolves around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open-Source Software</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is why I co-created <a href="http://www.railsfrance.org/">RailsFrance</a>, to help the RubyOnRails french community gain some visibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also co-organize the <a href="http://meetup.rubyparis.org/">Paris.rb</a> and I attend many events related to programming (<a href="http://rulu.eu/">Rulu</a>, <a href="http://railsberry.com/">RailsBerry</a>, <a href="http://osdc.fr/">OSDC</a>, <a href="http://wiki.agile-france.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?DojoDeveloppement">Coding Dojo</a>...).

            <h3>Passionate</h3>
            <p>
              Programming is not only my job, it's a passion. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I spend most of my free time reading about programming and everything that surrounds it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I strive to become better at what i do. Each new project is a opportunity to give my best.

            <h3>Honest and trustable</h3>
            <p>
              Honesty and trust are the most important points in a customer relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is why I try to be as transparent as possible with my clients, informing them as much as possible of my progressions and thoughts about their projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm not the kind of person who likes to stay in the dark, I guess you either, that's why I treat my customers as I would like to be treated in their place.
